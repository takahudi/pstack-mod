// the first heading of each skill its Per-skill notes table lists, and a
// runtime with a `prompts` directory a slash stub per public skill there. Pi
// has neither: its one pointer is hand-written in poteto-mode's Platform
// Adaptation section. `manifest` is the file the generator stamps VERSION
// into, `validate` checks the runtime's packaging against the tree once that
// manifest parses, and `hooks` lists the hooks files the manifest names,
// relative to the plugin root. GitHub Copilot stamps preambles but has no
// prompts directory, since its CLI and app list plugin skills as slash commands
// themselves, and no models.json block, since it ships no default models.
